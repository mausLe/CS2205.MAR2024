## Title

NL-to-Vis: A Natural Language Interface for Generating Business Data Visualization


## Abstract

Natural Language to Data Visualization (NL-to-Vis) offers an intuitive approach to data exploration, but current systems struggle with complex user queries. This leads to an under-specified visual generation that does not reflect user information needs. This research addresses this challenge in the context of Business Analytics (BA) by proposing three objectives:

Building the UITxNL-to-Vis Dataset of real-world BA visualizations and queries for NL-to-Vis evaluation and improvement. The dataset and annotations capture user intent and visual specifications. This is a complex and resource-intensive process.

Exploring Advanced NLP Techniques for NL-to-Vis to address limitations in NL-to-Vis, like the NL4DV baseline model. The proposal aims to research the more robust models that can effectively handle complex user queries.

Developing a NL-to-Vis interface, which enables users to explore data through natural language conversation. This makes data exploration more accessible and intuitive regardless of technical expertise in data analytics tools.
